# Recommendation_Engine
This is a content based  movie recommendation engine. 
We know that our recommendation engine will be content based. So, we need to find similar movies to a given movie and then recommend those similar movies to the user.

The Data set used for the project is 'Movie_dataset.csv'.
Content based recommendation engine:
This type of recommendation systems, takes in a movie that a user currently likes as input. Then it analyzes the contents (storyline, genre, cast, director etc.) of the movie to find out other movies which have similar content. Then it ranks similar movies according to their similarity scores and recommends the most relevant movies to the user.
